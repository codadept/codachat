## Getting started üéâ

By following the instructions you can get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites üìÑ

Your local machine must have [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which basically comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed.


```
node@v14.15.11 or higher
npm@6.14.11 or higher
git@2.31.1 or higher
```

---

### Let's see how to use? üõ†

Open your git bash in the required directory and first clone this repository-

```bash
# Clone this repository and the server repository
$ git clone https://github.com/codadept/codachat
$ git clone https://github.com/codadept/codachat-server

# First go into the server repository
$ cd codachat-server

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

Then install the dependencies using NPM-

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm start
```
```bash
# Once your server has started, now go to the codachat repository:
$ cd codachat
```

```bash
# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```
Open <u>index.html</u> using your favourite code editor and modify the script tag as such
```html
<script src="http://localhost:8000/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
```
instead of 
```html
<script src="https://codachat-server.herokuapp.com/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
```
And then open <u>app.js</u> and modify the line
```js
const socket = io('https://codachat-server.herokuapp.com/');
```
to 
```js
const socket = io('http://localhost:8000/');
```
Now open <u>index.html</u> in your favourite browser and enjoy the experience of the live chat app!

## Acknowledgments üòÉ

I was motivated to make this website as a way of learning more. The concept of this website is taken from a CodeWithHarry youtube video. socket.io has good documentation on their [website](https://socket.io) which makes it really easy for a start.
